# A REFLECTIVE REPORT ON THE ASSIGNMENT
A someone with no prior programming experience, my first impression of this assignment was fear. I read through the tasks to properly understand what was expected of me before proceeding to work on the solutions. I decided to start as early as possible because for me, the earlier, the better. I expected to conclude on the assignment way before the deadline to avoid any form of panic and consequently, errors. However, when I sat to work on the solutions, it became clear that I needed more personal studies before I can attempt the tasks myself. I went through previous workshops and online materials to be able to understand the different codes.  I gave myself a personal deadline to ensure I have enough time before the actual deadline; however, I did not factor in the time I would spend understanding the tasks and learning how to execute each task and how much time I’ll waste insisting on working on the tasks one after the other, in the order they came as opposed to skipping a challenging task for the next but less challenging one. Therefore, I did not meet my personal deadline and ended up submitting my assignment last submission date.

When I saw the tasks, I felt scared and clueless just like some of my course mates. By the time I started watching some online tutorial videos, I was quite happy and thought it would be smart to start early and then ask questions if I meet any hiccup. I was certain my plan was going to work, and therefore I got excited and motivated. Given that a couple of my course mates, like me, decided to start working on the task very early also further motivated me.  Looking back, I feel satisfied I put in the work and started as early as possible.

 I enjoyed working on all the tasks in this assignment. The lessons I learnt in the process cannot be over emphasized. The fact that every member of the class was focused on producing good quality work, motivated me to work harder. However, this process did not come without some speed bumps along the way. Certain tasks took me longer to conclude due to some technical issues and therefore, my overall time plan failed. I did not meet my personal deadline. 

Trying to create a database, create tables and populate them in task 3 was challenging. It took a couple of trials to succeed. For task 4, I was required to **Design, Write and Run SQL Queries**.I attempted using phpMyAdmin, but I had issues connecting to the server. Therefore, I opted to use MySQL workbench which also presented me with its own challenges. I could not connect to my host server, my password was not recognized, and I had to spend over 12hours trying to fix these issues and with the help of some online resources, I was able to resolve them. I ended up wasting so much time on these two tasks that my overall timeline was affected.
I thought my approach to attempt the tasks one after the other would be orderly and save me time in the end but didn’t think it through. It ended up costing me more time than anticipated and I had to rush through the final bit of report writing before submission.  I think the fact I didn’t consider the alternative even after I was advised to do so, led me to this situation.

Overall, this assignment was very insightful. I learnt a lot such as how to write a python code to create a database, create tables and populate these tables. I learnt about NoSQL databases and how to use MongoDB. I also learnt additional things outside the task such as Python libraries used for data visualization. These libraries are matplotlib and seaborn and they are very effective to achieve data visualization. Matplotlib helps make basic graphs for visualisation via bar charts, pie charts, histograms, scatterplots etc while seaborn has a couple of plots and patterns for visualization, uses interesting themes and contains several patterns and plots for data visualization.

I learned that in addition to giving myself a personal deadline, I must create an effective plan on how to achieve set goals. I learned that it is okay to ask for help instead of trying to figure out everything alone. Lastly, I learned about markdown format, how to use it and all its syntax. Going forward, I won’t insist on working on tasks one after the other. Instead of spending so much time on a very challenging task, I should attempt the less challenging ones. I will create S.M.A.R.T goals for myself to ensure I meet my deadline and avoid undue pressure. I’m confident this has prepared me for any python related task in the future.
